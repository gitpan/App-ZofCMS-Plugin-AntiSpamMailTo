App-ZofCMS-Plugin-AntiSpamMailTo

The module is an L<App::ZofCMS> plugin which provides means to deploy a technique that many
claim to be effective in protecting your C<< <a href="mailto:foo@bar.com"></a> >> links
from dumb spam bots.

The technique is quite simple (and simple to circumvent, but we are talking about B<dumb>
spam bots) - the entire contents of C<href=""> attribute are encoded as HTML entities. Dumb
spam bots miss the C<mailto:> and go their way. Anyway, on to the business.
